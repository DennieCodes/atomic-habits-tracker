#Atomic Habits Tracker

One of my favorite books is Atomic Habits by James Clear. I have been utilizing different strategies from this book and it has helped me
to organize my activities and work towards my goals. I currently use pencil and paper to track my habits but I believe that a well designed
app would be very suitable to handle this activity instead.
